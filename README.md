# better-lbry-resolver
A simple tool to easily resolve LBRY network claims. 
I've built it for personal use while working on [Actarius](https://github.com/Shroom2020/actarius-lbry-browser)
It curently uses Odysee API and simple resolve (https://lbry.tech/api/sdk#resolve), but it will be expanded in the future.

# How to use it?
Just unzip the file and run index.html

# Tested on:
Chrome 95.0.4638.69
Firefox required additional plugin to enable CORS

# To Do:
- [ ] Add local LBRYNET support
- [ ] Add other API calls
- [ ] Make better UI
